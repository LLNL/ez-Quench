ezQ_plotTestCov.py
created:  2024-Nov-08 RAS - rename from test_error_fit.py to create figures for Appendix B
modified: 2024-Nov-22 RAS - increase label/legend font size

This is a standalone routine (data & errors included) to fit an exponential function to 
the ATLAS jet-RAA for central 5.02 TeV PbPb collisions for a set 5 error matrices
 1. stat-only
 2. stat+sys
 3. cov-sum
 4. cov-all
 5. cov-20%

Each error treatment above is fit in three ways
 1. standard chi2 minimization
 2. chi2 on log transform 
 3. flip-data about stat-only fit and then refit
